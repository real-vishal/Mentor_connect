Zenbot, is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging application.","is how a chatbot works?":"Chatbots work using a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and pre-programmed rules. Here's a basic overview of how they function Input Understanding: When you type a message, the chatbot uses NLP techniques to interpret your text. This involves breaking down your message into understandable components and identifying the key elements and intent. Processing: The chatbot then processes this input using algorithms and models to determine the appropriate response. It may use predefined rules, patterns, or machine learning models to generate an answer.Response Generation: Based on the processing, the chatbot generates a response. This could be a direct answer, a follow-up question, or a task execution (like booking an appointment or retrieving information).Learning and Improvement: More advanced chatbots use machine learning to improve over time. They analyze interactions, learn from user feedback, and refine their responses to provide better and more accurate answers in the future.Chatbots range from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated AI-driven models, depending on their design and intended use.",//hackathonrelatedDatasets
